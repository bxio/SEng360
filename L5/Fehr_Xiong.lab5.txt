3) What is the row and column for the data for auth_flag?
4) Do you notice anything odd about the order in which auth_flag and password_buffer appears in code and how it is laid out in memory?
5) Why does the password_buffer display "" when the entire first line is the buffer and data exists in 3 of the blocks displayed?
6) What do you think is more useful in finding problems and exploiting them: source code or disassembled code? Why?
